	<long_description>Wii Donut, a spinning donut for your Wii!
All the hard work was done by Andy Sloane (donut generation code) and Jogeir Liljedahl (the sweet music), I just threw it on a Wii. HEAVILY modified by Korbo.

GBA Donut requires a GBA link cable plugged in the 2nd controller port.

Music can be changed by adding a "music.(mod/it/s3m/xm/etc.)" file in the app directory.
This program supports *most* tracker music formats.
